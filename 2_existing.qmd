## Introduction

This section will document the modeling of existing traffic conditions.
These conditions were modeled to evaluate the current performance of the interchange.
This section will outline the study parameters, model setup and results from the existing interchange analysis.

## Model Setup

To model the interchange accurately, turning movement counts were collected for the intersections in the study area.
Traffic counting cameras were set up on September 26, 2023 at the I-15 NB Interchange, I-15 SB Interchange, and Main St/900 N to capture volumes.
Volumes were then counted via the footage using CountPRO software [@CountPro].
Automated Traffic Signal Performance Measure (ATSPM) data [@ATSPM] were used for the volumes for Main St/600 N. The turning movement counts are shown in Tables [-@tbl-am-tmc] and [-@tbl-pm-tmc].
It should be noted that the South interchange was modeled as a five-leg intersection.
These tables reference 800 N as the auxiliary fifth leg of this intersection because it is somewhat separated from the other approaches of the intersection, but still interacts with it.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-am-tmc
#| tbl-cap: "AM Turning Movement Counts at the Study Area"

targets::tar_load(am_peak_turn_counts)

am_peak_turn_counts %>% format_turning_counts() %>% 
  kable_styling(latex_options = "HOLD_position")
```

```{r}
#| label: tbl-pm-tmc
#| tbl-cap: "PM Turning Movement Counts at the Study Area"

targets::tar_load(pm_peak_turn_counts)

am_peak_turn_counts %>% format_turning_counts()
```

Data were collected at Main Street and 600 N and 900 N due to interactions with the existing interchange.
Additionally, the junction of the I-15 NB Interchange was modeled with the 800 N junction to evaluate interactions.
Specifically at 800 N, volumes entering and exiting the approach were quite low, but it was decided to keep that intersection for the completeness of the model.

These turning movement counts were used as inputs for a model built with PTV VISSIM [@VISSIM].
The VISSIM model also required the roadway geometry to be modeled using links and nodes, which loosely follow the actual geometry of the interchange.
This construction of this model is outlined in this section.

The VISSIM model was developed off the UDOT VISSIM template [@template] and is shown in @fig-vissim_existing_all.
The template provided speed distributions and driver characteristics approved by the UDOT Traffic group.

![Existing VISSIM Model](figures/existing/everythinge.png){#fig-vissim_existing_all}

Desired speed decisions were modeled based off posted speed limits and confirmed with the UDOT Speed Limit Map [@SpeedLimits].
Roadway geometries were based off the most current versions of the Google Roadview imagery [@Google].
A brief site visit was conducted by a member of the team to confirm key roadway characteristics.

Geometries were loosely designed with the only measurements being the left and right turn bays.
Radii and curvature were approximated based on satellite imagery.
Elevations, superelevations, and roadway crowns were not modeled in the network.
On turns, reduced speed areas were placed to resemble driver behavior.

Signal timing plans were obtained from UDOT's MaxView [@maxview] database on September 24th, 2023.
The I-15 SB Interchange and Main St/600 N are fully actuated ring-barrier-controlled intersections, but are not coordinated.
Timings and signal characteristics were modeled to match the timing plans and roadway geometry.

Where appropriate, conflict areas, and priority rules were placed to govern vehicle behavior.
Behavior leading to vehicle conflict was minimized to the best ability of the modeler.
Due to the lack of related traffic, bicycles and pedestrians were not modeled.
However, future models should provide for bicycle and pedestrian facilities.
It was only due to the lack of data that these users were not modeled.

The collected data did indicate a higher percentage of high grossing vehicles, and such percentages were modeled in the vehicle inputs.
Due to the limited collected data, over calibration was avoided by preventing elevated levels of detail in the model.

Vehicle movements were created by developing an origin-destination (OD) matrix for the network using RStudio with the DiagrammeR [@DiagrammeR] and gtools [@gtools] packages.
A network graph and turning movement percentages were calculated for each node.
Routes between nodes were developed with the network graph, and route distributions were calculated based on the turning movement percentages.
Thus, approximate OD movements were created and inputted into the model.

<!-- show the od figure? -->

No adjustment factors were used in the creation of input volumes, so the data do not reflect AADT, but are valid for the purposes of this study.
Based on the collected data, an A.M.
peak of 7:15--8:15 A.M., and an P.M.
peak of 4:30--5:30 P.M.
were estimated and corresponding values were used in the calculation of the input volumes and OD distribution.

An initial loading period was implemented by duplicating "0--15" volumes.
Following the loading period, a simulation run of 60 minutes (15-minute bins) was conducted.
Ten model iterations of both A.M.
and P.M.
models were run.

Travel time data was not collected for this network, nor was any Bluetooth or radar data collected.
The VISSIM model was calibrated only by visual observations to confirm accuracy of driver behavior.
No further elements were considered for the calibration of the model.

## Results

Tables [-@tbl-am-los] and [-@tbl-pm-los] display the results of the analysis performed in the VISSIM model for both the A.M.
and P.M.
peak periods.
Level of Service was determined from the Highway Capacity Manual 7^th^ edition [@hcm7].
Each of the approaches are performing relatively well under the existing conditions.
Points of concern are approaches with a single lane that service all vehicle movements.
The approaches include the 900 N and I-15 NB Off-ramp with LOS C. With additional loading, it is likely that the network could see considerable reductions in service capabilities.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-pm-los
#| tbl-cap: Existing Model Results (PM Peak)

```

These results will be valuable for further analysis at the study location.
However, there is not an apparent need for the interchange to be modified based on this analysis alone.
