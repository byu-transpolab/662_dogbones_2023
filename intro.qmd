## Introduction

The existing I-15 interchange at Main Street in Payson, Utah is under investigation for a potential redesign. The Main Street interchange is one of two interchanges serving the city of Payson. It connects I-15 to Main Street, which is classified as a minor arterial [@FuncClass] and carries an Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) of 15,000 veh per day [@AADT]. Due to growth and increased travel in the area, the interchange is being investigated for a potential redesign to better serve the Payson and nearby Benjamin, Utah communities. UDOT prepared an Environmental Impact Statement in 2019 for the interchange and proposed a series of braided ramps to connect the existing interchange to the proposed Nebo Beltway, just northeast of Main Street [@UDOTStudy]. This study will provide a second evaluation of the existing conditions and potential redesign options for the interchange. @fig-study-area shows imagery of the study area.

## Outline

The following report will consist of six sections. First, the team will explain the model existing conditions created using traffic counts and signal timing plans. Second, the team will outline a future configuration with justifications from existing crash data. Third, the team will approximate future growth rates using the MATSim modeling package. Fourth, the team will check the model for resiliency during various car-following model variations. Fifth, the team will review results from the no-build and build models. The team will then summarize key findings and provide recommendations for future consideration.
