## Introduction

This section will document the evaluation of projected 2050 volumes in \"build\" and \"no-build\" scenarios for the proposed redesign of the I-15 interchange at Main Street in Payson, Utah.
The projected volumes were created using MATSim [@MATSim].
MATSim simulates individual travelers in a transportation network and \"trains\" them to find the optimal path during their tour by running the simulation through multiple iterations.
This section will outline information for the population creation model, the MATSim network, forecasted volumes, the resulting turning counts from the MATSim model, and forecasted turning movement counts.

## Population Creation

The population creation model used is very simple.
Given a total population, each person is given a random, normally-distributed home location within Payson.
@tbl-locdist gives the mean and standard deviation (SD) of the latitude and longitude, given in World Geodetic System coordinates.
These values come from population-weighted block group data from the 2010 Census [@census_united_2010].
@fig-loaded-network shows a sample of the population distribution.
This model is not a good fit to estimate household and trip destination locations, but is serviceable for the purposes of this project.

| Mean Latitude | Mean Longitude | SD Latitude | SD Longitude |
|---------------|----------------|-------------|--------------|
| 40.03375      | -111.7362      | 0.0105619   | 0.0135612    |

: Location Distributions {#tbl-locdist}

![MATSim Loaded Payson network](matsim/Home.jpg){#fig-loaded-network}

@quickfacts_payson gives a 2022 population of 22,516 for Payson.
The population for Payson in 2050 was projected using a growth rate based on the Utah County growth over the same time period.
Based on numbers from the Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute, the population of Utah County in 2022 was 702,943 and the projected population for 2050 is 1,185,679 [@uou_state_2022].
This is a growth of 68.7% from 2022 to 2050, which gives a population of 37,979 in 2050.

## Plan Assignment

Each person is assigned a tour which includes zero or more activities.
These tours include a list of destinations and arrival times for each event.
All trips are assigned to a personal vehicle, but the route that the vehicle takes is derived through a best fit algorithm.
Tour type was randomly assigned by the distribution included in [@tbl-tourtypedist].
These values were derived from the 2017 National Household Travel Survey [@travel_national_2017] for metropolitan areas between one and three million people.
Note that the tour type assigned to an individual is dependent on their employment status.
Based on information provided for this project, 42% of the total population was designated as a worker.

| Person Type | Home  | Mandatory | Discretionary |
|-------------|-------|-----------|---------------|
| Non-Worker  | 0.229 | 0.165     | 0.605         |
| Worker      | 0.083 | 0.632     | 0.285         |

: Tour Type Distribution {#tbl-tourtypedist}

"Home" tours include no activities outside the home.

Mandatory tours consist of a trip to I-15 NB or SB and a possible discretionary activity on the way to the home location.
Coordinates were selected on the north and southern ends of the model to assign individuals to travel in such direction either going north to Spanish Fork/Provo and beyond, or south to Santaquin/Nephi and beyond.
A random distribution assigned 95% of all mandatory trips NB.
The start times for mandatory activities were assigned randomly between 7 and 9 AM, and the end times between 4 and 6 PM.
Mandatory tours were given a 50% chance to complete a discretionary trip.
Discretionary trip destinations were selected from the same distribution described in @tbl-locdist.
All discretionary trips originated from the mandatory trip location and ended at the "home" location.
After returning "home" the mandatory tour was completed.

Discretionary tours are comprised of one to three discretionary activities.
These destinations were created from the normal distribution as described in @tbl-locdist.
Start and end times for the tour were constrained to be between 6 am and 10 pm.
Each subsequent activity begins at a random time after the previous one.
End times were similarly assigned but with a correction factor to ensure that activities end by 10 PM.

A random distribution was developed to determine if activities were consecutive, or if users returned to their "home" location in between.
If a single trip had been taken, there was a 40% that they would return home, if two trips, 60%, and if three trips, then 80%.
This distribution was created to reflect personal opinions of the likelihood of concurrent trips after a given number of previous concurrent trips.
Once all trips or the day ended, whichever came first, the discretionary tour was completed.

## MATSim Network

The team was provided with a network for the Payson MATSim model that roughly modeled the actual roadway network in and around Payson.
Using this network means that the paths that agents take should be close to available paths in Payson.
Attributes included in each roadway link were speed, number of lanes, and capacity.
Originally, there were some critical errors in the network that led to the failure of MATSim, and so the network was run through the MATSim "NetworkCleaner".
No other efforts were made to verify the accuracy of the network.
[@fig-network] displays the MATSim network overlaid on a map of Payson.

## Results

The MATSim model was run with the existing population size for Payson and again with a projected population size for Payson.
[@tbl-tmc] shows the calculated MATSim turning movement counts for each intersection at the study area for 2022 and 2050.
These intersections are visualized in [@fig-via] and hourly traffic patterns are shown.
Intersection movement counts were collected for the entire simulation run time due to extensive delays in the PM period.
The growth rate was calculated as shown in @eq-growth.

$$
Growth(\%)=\frac{2050 - 2022 \; \text{Volumes}}{2022 \; \text{Volumes}} \times 100\%
$$ {#eq-growth}

| Intersection   | 2022 24-hour Volume | 2050 24-hour Volume | Growth Rate (2022--2050) |
|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| 900 N      | 5295                | 7354                | 38.9%                    |
| SB Interchange | 7983                | 11101               | 39.1%                    |
| NB Interchange | 8883                | 11716               | 31.9%                    |
| 600 N      | 6806                | 8846                | 30.0%                    |

: Existing and Projected Turning Movement Counts {#tbl-tmc}

![Existing and projected turning movement counts.](figures/matsim_intersections/VIA_diagram.png){#fig-via}

As presented in @tbl-tmc, the northern intersections exhibit a growth of approximately 40% from 2022 to 2050 while the southern intersections exhibit a growth of approximately 30% from 2022 to 2050.

Turning movement proportions were very similar between the 2022 and 2050 models.
[@fig-via] shows the turning movement distributions and histograms illustrating the volume breakdowns between the 2022 and 2050 models.
Generally, the distributions widen in 2050, with the PM queues taking more than two additional hours to dissipate in the 2050 model as compared to the 2022 model (from 7pm to 9:30pm).

Each segment in the network was heavily utilized as drivers looked for the best cost path that would minimize the time and distance traveled.
The most severe congestion was present along Main Street in the AM peak and the SB I-15 corridor in the PM peak.
These segments are well over capacity.
However, given the experimental nature of the methodology it is unwise to make planning judgments from this model.
The rough growth rates collected from the model will be reviewed and implemented in future steps.

Also, of note are Figures [-@fig-2022-scores] and [-@fig-2050-scores] which illustrate that over the 200 iterations, the model appears to converge to an equilibrium fit.
The 2050 model required more interactions to converge, but after about 190 iterations were consistent in its convergence.
The 2022 model converged after about 125 interactions, likely due to the lower volumes in the network.

![MATSim scores for 2050 model.](figures/matsim/scorestats2050.png){#fig-2050-scores height="3.5in" fig-pos="p"}

Figures [-@fig-hist-2022] and [-@fig-2050-hist] show the trip distributions for the 200th iteration.
The strong peaks at the beginning and end of the time period reflects the stay-at-home and discretionary individuals as the model treats them as starting their "home" trip at 6 AM and returning "home" at 10 PM.
During the AM peak, drivers are able to reach their destinations sooner, leading to a smaller number of vehicle hours traveled.
The PM peak has a significantly higher number of vehicles hours traveled due to the higher levels of congestion.

![Trip histogram for 2022 model.](figures/matsim/200.legHistogram_all2022.png){#fig-hist-2022 height="3.5in" fig-pos="p"}

![Trip histogram for 2050 model.](figures/matsim/200.legHistogram_all2050.png){#fig-2050-hist height="3.5in" fig-pos="p"}

It is possible that there may be a error in the network file that reduced the capacity of the I-15 SB segments, leading to a inflation in delay.
The sharp bins in departures from 6-8 AM and 4-6 PM illustrate the modeling characteristics of the model as mandatory trips were forced to leave during those time frames.

The traffic volumes at the study area were projected using a growth rate derived from the MATSim model.
Growth rates were determined individually for each intersection using aggregate volumes.
Rather than using the projected volumes produced by MATSim, the growth rate was applied to the volumes used in the VISSIM model for existing traffic to calculate projected traffic volumes.
Even though the traffic volumes produced by the MATSim model are incomplete, the growth rates calculated from MATSim are reasonable to apply to the VISSIM model as an academic exercise.
@tbl-vissim-growth shows the growth rates applied to the existing counts that were collected for the existing VISSIM model.
OD pairs will be calculated from this data and used in the "No-Build 2050" and "Build 2050" models for future analysis.

```

## Conclusions

MATSim provides a method for creating turning counts even with limited prediction models.
As an academic exercise, these results and growth rates will be used to forecast growth in VISSIM to provide limited recommendations for future growth at the I-15 interchange at Main Street in Payson, Utah.
