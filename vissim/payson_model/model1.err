                  Warning	The link gradient experienced by vehicles depends on the link attribute "Gradient" according to the network settings. This attribute has the value zero for all links but some links have a Z-offset. These Z-coordinates are ignored for the vehicle behavior. If the Z-coordinates are meant to affect the vehicles, please select that option in the network settings.
