A potential redesign of the I-15 interchange at Main Street in Payson, Utah was tested using a Vissim model.
This redesign is a "dogbone" interchange where the North and South intersections are roundabouts. 
This document outlines the study parameters, model setup and results from the potential dogbone interchange analysis. 

<!-- The Main Street interchange is one of two interchanges serving the city of Payson. It connects I-15 to Main Street, which is classified as a minor arterial [@FuncClass] and carries an Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) of 15,000 veh per day [@AADT]. Due to growth and increased travel in the area, the interchange is being investigated for a potential redesign to better serve the Payson and nearby Benjamin, Utah communities. UDOT prepared an Environmental Impact Statement in 2019 for the interchange and proposed a series of braided ramps to connect the existing interchange to the proposed Nebo Beltway, just northeast of Main Street [@UDOTStudy]. This study will provide a second evaluation of the existing conditions and potential redesign options for the interchange. @fig-study-area shows imagery of the study area. -->

# Model Setup



# Results

<!-- Tables [-@tbl-am-los] and [-@tbl-pm-los] display the results of the analysis performed in the VISSIM model for both the A.M. and P.M. peak periods. Level of Service was determined from the Highway Capacity Manual 7^th^ edition [@hcm7]. Each of the approaches are performing relatively well under the existing conditions. Points of concern are approaches with a single lane that service all vehicle movements. The approaches include the 900 N and I-15 NB Off-ramp with LOS C. With additional loading, it is likely that the network could see considerable reductions in service capabilities. -->
